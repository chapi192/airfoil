#there are 9 total nodes including the center with individual weights

we need the window dimensions, desired viscocity and how many iterations to do

windowX
windowY
viscocity
simLength

2d array where elements in the array are the direction of the node and weights:

nodes = [ [x, y, weight], [] ....]

Initialize fluid to flow to the right in each cell

Each partition in the sim should have a true or false value. True if it is part of 
an object the fluid is moving around and false if it is empty space. So if we are in 
a false section we dont need to do any calculation on the nodes

For time in simLenght:
    
    permute through the paritions and calculate the conditions F_i on the i-th node for
    
    for parition in window:
    
        for node in parition:
            
            evaluate density and velocity
            
            if moving into object:
                reverse velocity
            
            move node in direction of velocity
